# Unity 2D Pixel Perfect Collider
Unity 2D Pixel Perfect Collider is a simple C# script that can comes jam packed with features to help you automatically generate pixel perfect polygon colliders.

# How To Use
To get started download ![Unity2DPixelPerfectCollider.cs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomiaGaming/Unity2DPixelPerfectCollider/master/Unity2DPixelPerfectCollider.cs) and save it to your Unity project's assets folder. This one file contains all the code you will need. From there you can just add the PixelCollider2D component to a GameObject with a SpriteRenderer and a PolygonCollider2D and press Regenerate Collider to automatically pixel perfect fit the PolygonCollider2D to the SpriteRenderer.

# What About Tilemaps?
Regenerating PolygonCollider2Ds one at a time for each GameObject is fine for simple games but for complex projects with tons of GameObjects it's not realistic nor optimized. Instead select Window>Pixel Physics Shape Editor to open the handy window. From this window you can drag and drop Sprites or folders full of Sprites to add them to the selected sprites list. Then when you press Generate And Apply Physics Shapes it will automatically generate pixel perfect sprite shapes for each of your Sprites. A sprite shape is a feature of the Unity sprite editor which allows users to define the default shape for colliders when representing the collider for that sprite. By setting the sprite shape of all our Sprites to pixel perfect outlines we ensure that all future PolygonCollider2Ds or Tiles will have pixel perfect hitboxes. From there you can just create Tiles the same way you normally would and set the Collider Type to Sprite to make use of pixel perfect colliders for Tilemaps too!

# Readability
In order to generate a pixel perfect outline of a given Sprite or Texture2D the pixel data of the texture must be readable. In Unity Texture2Ds can be read/writable or not depending on their asset import settings. To ensure that you don't run into issues make sure that you enable read/write for any textures you wish to generate pixel perfect colliders for. You can do this by right clicking on a Texture2D in the Project window and selecting Properties. Then check the box under Advanced>Read/Write. Alternatively my library has OnTextureUnreadable settings which can be configured to determine what should happen if a Texture2D is unreadable. For more information about these settings read the comments at the very top of Unity2DPixelPerfectCollider.cs.
